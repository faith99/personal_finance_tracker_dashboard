#  Personal Finance Tracker Dashboard (Excel)

Welcome to my **Personal Finance Tracker Dashboard**,an Excel-based dashboard I created to help visualize and better understand personal income and spending habits over a 10-month period.

This project was inspired by a fantastic tutorial and dataset shared by [@ObohX on Twitter](https://x.com/ObohX)—big shoutout for making personal finance tracking so approachable and insightful! 🙌

##Dashboard overview

The dataset used for this dashboard covers **January to October**, and includes detailed transaction data with the following fields:

- **Date** of transaction  
- **Description** of transaction  
- **Debit Amount** (expenses)  
- **Credit Amount** (income)  
- **Sub-Category** of transaction  
- **Category** of transaction  
- **Category Type** (e.g., Income or Expense)  
- **Month Number**  
- **Month Name**  
- **Weekday**  
- **Net Amount** (Credit - Debit)

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard contains interactive **pivot tables and visualizations** that give you a comprehensive overview of your financial activity. Here's what you'll find:

-  **Balance:** Sum of Net Amount  
-  **Total Income:** Sum of Credit Amount  
-  **Total Spending:** Sum of Debit Amount  
-  **Maximum Income (Single Transaction)**  
-  **Maximum Spending (Single Transaction)**  
-  **Income Sources:** Credit by Sub-Category  
-  **Top 5 Spending Sub-Categories**  
-  **Monthly Income Trends**  
-  **Monthly Spending Trends**  
-  **Income vs Spending (By Month)**  
-  **Income vs Spending (By Weekday)**

###  Filters

To make the dashboard even more interactive, I included a **Slicer** that lets you filter the entire view by **Month**. This helps zoom in on specific periods and analyze spending/income habits more closely.
